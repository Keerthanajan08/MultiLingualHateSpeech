# Multilingual Hate Speech Detection

A Multilingual Hate Speech Detection System that supports text, audio, and video inputs. It uses fine-tuned transformer models (Llama 2 / HuggingFace) along with speech-to-text pipelines to classify content as hate speech or non-hate speech.

## ✨ Features

🔤 Text Classification – Detects hate speech in multilingual text

🎙️ Audio Support – Converts speech to text via Google Speech Recognition API

🎥 Video Support – Uses Whisper to transcribe video / YouTube content before classification

📊 Performance – Achieved 97% accuracy on benchmark dataset

🌍 Multilingual – Supports multiple languages

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers

Google Speech Recognition API

OpenAI Whisper

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn
